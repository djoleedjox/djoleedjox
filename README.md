Hello there! 👋 

I am self-taught programmer who is currently a student. I've sailed into the world of programming through modding and scripting for
the Half-Life Gold Source engine around 6 years ago, and then later moved to frontend web development. I've worked with numerous
technologies and projects, but I still think of myself as a humble beginner and I want to learn more and get better.

◆ 🔬 I'm looking to collaborate on: Open Source projects.
